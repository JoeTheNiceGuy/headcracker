School project 

This is suppose to be a toy puzzle were you have to complete a image or pattern(in this case a pattern), by moving one space at a time.
I did the barebone of it but im having trouble switching out the spots when executing.
there are the restriction of using:
  1.just simple arrays 
  2. no arraylist.
  3. No othre class than Scanner.
  
 This is soppose to be just linear codding.
